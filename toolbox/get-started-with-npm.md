# Get Started with Npm

This is a brief guide on how to get started with npm. For more detailed explanation/tutorials, please see the resources at the bottom of this page.

Npm makes it easier for developers to share and reuse code. With it you can download and use JavaScript libraries others (or yourself) have written. There are packages that give you cool CSS transformations, helps with time formatting, and helps you use charts.

**Create a package.json file**

A `package.json` file will keep track on all the packages you have installed. To create one, run the following command and answer the questions the best way you see fit:

```sh
$ npm init
```

**Install a package**

At [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) you can browse all packages. Once you find one you like, run:

```sh
npm install --save name-of-package
```
